# Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator program in Java. It was developed as a final project to demonstrate basic programming logic and the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The calculator possesses the ability of carrying out basic mathematical calculations and has a basic, user-friendly interface.

## Features ‚ú®

  * **Basic Arithmetic:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** A clear display for input and results with intuitive button controls.
  * **OOP Design:** Built using key OOP concepts for a robust and maintainable structure.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

  **Language:** Java
  **IDE:** Developed using Visual Studio Code (but can be run with any Java-supported IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA)
  **GUI Framework:** Java Swing (for the graphical user interface)

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Applied üß†

This project was designed to specifically showcase an understanding of OOP. 
You must use at least four of these concepts in your application.

  **Classes and Objects**: The application is structured around classes like `Calculator` (to handle the main logic and state) and `Operation` (to represent mathematical actions). Objects of these classes are instantiated to run the application.

  **Encapsulation**: The internal state of the `Calculator` class (like the current display value or pending operation) is kept private. Access to this state is controlled through public methods, preventing direct, uncontrolled modification from outside the class.

  **Abstraction**: An abstract `Operation` class was created to serve as a blueprint. It defines a method signature, like `perform(a, b)`, that all specific operation classes must implement, abstracting the concept of a mathematical operation.

  **Inheritance**: Concrete classes such as `Addition`, `Subtraction`, `Multiplication`, and `Division` inherit from the abstract `Operation` class. This allows them to share a common type while providing their own unique implementation of the `perform` method.

  **Polymorphism**: The `Calculator` can use a single method to execute any operation. This method accepts an object of the `Operation` parent class. When the method is called, Java's runtime polymorphism ensures the correct `perform` method of the subclass (e.g., `Addition` or `Multiplication`) is executed.
